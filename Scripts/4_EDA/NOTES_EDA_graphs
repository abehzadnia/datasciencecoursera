#### Principles of Analytic Graphics:
#######################################

Principle 1: Show comparison 
- Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative

Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explaination

Principle 3: Show multivariate data
- Able to give a richer story

Pricinple 4: Integration of evidence
- Integrate words, numbers images and diagrams

Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales etc
- Data graphic should tell a complete story

Principle 6: Content is king
- Presentation stand or fall depending on the quality, relavanece

#### Why do we use graphs in data analysis:
###########################################

1- understand data properties
2- find patterns
3- suggest modeling strategies
4- debug analyses
5- communicate results

EDA aims to achieve the first 4 principles. Some of their characteristics:
- Made quickly
- large numbers are made
- Goal is for personal understanindg

Examples:
- 5 point summary
- Histograms (play around with breaks and add a rug() and abline() to it)
- Boxplot (add abline() to make it more informative)
- Barplot (for categorical variables)

These plots are often quick and dirty and elt us summarise the data graphically.
They also help us to explore basic questions and form hypotheses, and suggesting modeling strategies.

Examples:
- R Graph Gallery
- R Blogger

#### Plotting Systems in R
###########################################

1- Artist's Plot (package: base)
Plot function in the base package which allows plotting and adding other plots features.
Disadvantage of this method is the inability to quickly change the annotations etc. 

2- Lattice System (package:Lattice)
Plots are created using single function (e.g. xyplot, bwplot). as it requires a lot of condition, a lot of data needs to be parsed into the functions before able to plot it.

Good for putting many plots on screen (panel plots) - but required conditioning. However, annotations are all calcualted by default.

The disadvantage is the difficulty in specifying an entire plot as well as annotating. Although can use some functions to add to the canvas but it caant.

3- ggplot2 (package:ggplot2)
Grammar of graphics plot. Mixes ideas from both base package and lattice system. Alot of the aesthetic and annotations are also automatically put in.
